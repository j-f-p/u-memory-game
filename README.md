## Matching Game Project

### Abstract
This a browser game project initialized from a starter project from a Udacity web development course. It is a fixed-view single-player game involving a rectangular grid of cards. 

### Environment and Technical Features
The game is built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It has been tested with Chrome and Firefox, and their respective device and responsiveness tools. The game involves a single view with event listeners, a score panel and a modal.

### Game Description
This is a one player game about revealing cards by matching. The game has a set of cards comprising only matching pairs. Each card is positioned separately in a rank and file formation. Initially, all cards are face down. A game move occurs when a card becomes face up, by clicking on it. The objective of the game is to reveal all cards, with as few moves as possible. 

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rules
- At most, two unmatched cards can be face up.
- An attempt to have a third card face up will cause the face up cards to be face down, leaving the attempted third card the only card face up.
- When a match is made, the matching cards remain face up.
- After achieving the objective, a star rating is given to the player based on how many moves the player made.
